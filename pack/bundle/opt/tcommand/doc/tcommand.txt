*tcommand.txt*      Select and execute a command or menu item from a list

VIM plugins are cool but with time you forget about even useful 
commands. This plugin provides a command (|:TCommand|) that lets you 
select a command from a list (you can optionally display help on the 
currently hightlighted command) and then run it from the command line.
It thus provides an alternative to the built-in command-line completion.
