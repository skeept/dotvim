<!-- Please explain the issue in detail (actual behavior). -->

### Expected behavior

<!-- What did you expect or want to happen? -->

### Steps to reproduce

<!--
Provide steps to reproduce the issue, if relevant.

1. Please set `g:neomake_logfile`, e.g. using
   `:let g:neomake_logfile = '/tmp/neomake.log'` first.
   You can also set `:let g:neomake_verbose = 3` to display debug messages
   directly, but that can be distracting (i.e. forcing hit-ENTER prompts).
2. Look at the logfile (or `:messages`) for the generated output, which might
   help revealing the issue already.
3. Please describe how you run Neomake: manually (how?), via automake config,
   or via some custom autocommand(s) (which? - not recommended anymore).
-->

### Output from (verbose) NeomakeInfo

<!--

1. Paste the output from `:verbose NeomakeInfo` here.
   You can use `:verbose NeomakeInfo!` (with a bang at the end) to copy it to
   your clipboard.

2. If relevant paste the contents of the logfile (via `g:neomake_logfile`).
