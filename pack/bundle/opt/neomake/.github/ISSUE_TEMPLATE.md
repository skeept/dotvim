<!-- Please explain the issue in detail (actual behavior). -->

### Expected behavior

<!-- What did you expect or want to happen? -->

### Steps to reproduce

<!--
Provide steps to reproduce the issue, if relevant.

1. Please execute `:let g:neomake_verbose = 3` first, to enable verbose
   output/logging in general, or set `g:neomake_logfile` to a file path.
2. Look at `:messages` (or the logfile) for the generated output, which might
   help revealing the issue already.
-->

### Output from (verbose) NeomakeInfo

<!--
Paste the output from `:verbose NeomakeInfo` here.
You can use the following command to copy it directly to your clipboard:

    :redir @+> | silent verb NeomakeInfo | redir END

If you have used `g:neomake_logfile`, then please paste the contents of the
file here, too.
