<!-- Please explain the issue in detail (actual behavior). -->

### Expected behavior

<!-- What did you expect or want to happen? -->

### Steps to reproduce

<!--
Provide steps to reproduce the issue, if relevant.

1. Please execute `:let g:neomake_verbose = 3` first, to enable verbose
   output/logging in general, or set `g:neomake_logfile` to a file path.
2. Look at `:messages` (or the logfile) for the generated output, which might
   help revealing the issue already.
3. Please describe how you run Neomake: manually (how?), or via some custom
   autocommand(s) (which?).
-->

### Output from (verbose) NeomakeInfo

<!--

1. Paste the output from `:verbose NeomakeInfo` here.
   You can use `:verbose NeomakeInfo!` (with a bang at the end) to copy it to
   your clipboard.

   If you want to copy it manually to some other register etc you can use
   something based on the following:

        :redir @+> | silent verb NeomakeInfo | redir END

2. If you have used `g:neomake_logfile`, then please paste the contents of the
   file here, too.
