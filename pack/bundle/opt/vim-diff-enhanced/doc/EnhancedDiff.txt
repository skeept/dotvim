Functionality

The EnhancedDiff plugin allows to use different diff algorithms. This can
greatly improve the use of |vimdiff| by making a diff more readable. To make
use of different diff algorithms, this plugin makes use of the git command
line tool to generate a unified diff and converts that diff to a normal "ed"
style diff (|diff-diffexpr|) to make vimdiff use that diff.

You could also use other diff tools if you like, as long as those generate a
diff in the "unified" form.

By default is disabled, which means, it uses the default diff algorithm (also
known as myers algorithm).
                                                    *EnhancedDiff-algorithms*
git supports 4 different diff algorithms. Those are:

    Algorithm       Description~
    myers           Default diff algorithm
    default         Alias for myers
    minimal         Like myers, but tries harder to minimize the resulting
                    diff
    patience        Use the patience diff algorithm
    histogram       Use the histogram diff algorithm (similar to patience but
                    slightly faster)

Note you need at least git version 1.8.2 or higher. Older versions do not
support all those algorithms.

                                                                *:EnhancedDiff*
To specify a different diff algorithm use this command: >

    :EnhancedDiff <algorithm>
<
Use any of the above algorithm for creating the diffs. You can use <Tab> to
complete the different algorithms.

                                                               *:PatienceDiff*
Use the :PatienceDiff to select the "patience" diff algorithm.

The selected diff algorithm will from then on be used for all the diffs that
will be generated in the future. If you are in diff mode (|vimdiff|) the diff
should be updated immediately.

                                                        *:EnhancedDiffDisable*
Use the :EnhancedDiffDisable command to disable this plugin.

                                                        *:EnhancedDiffIgnorePat*

Use the command :EnhancedDiffIgnorePat to add patterns to the ignore list: >

   :EnhancedDiffIgnorePat [-buffer] \%.*<10c [<replace>]
<
This will add the pattern "\%.*<10c" (all text before column 10) to the
ignorelist. Internally this works by replacing the pattern by a common string
so that the diff command does not see a difference. Most probably won't work
with multi-line patterns.

Use the "!" attribute to remove all existing patterns and set it to the given
pattern only.

If [-buffer] is given, will use buffer-local variable for the ignore pattern.
In that case, the <replace> part must be given!

If <replace> is given, will use that as replacement part for the pattern

Note: This only works, if EnhancedDiff has been enabled, e.g. after: >

    :EnhancedDiff default
<
                                                          *EnhancedDiff-vimrc*
If you want e.g. the patience diff algorithm to be the default when using the
|vimdiff| command, you need to set the 'diffexpr' option manually like this
in your |.vimrc| >

  :let &diffexpr='EnhancedDiff#Diff("git diff", "--diff-algorithm=patience")'
<
Since internally, EnhancedDiff does simply set up the 'diffexpr' option.

An alternative to this method is the following:

Create a file after/plugin/patiencediff.vim in your default runtimepath (e.g.
~/.vim/ directory on Linux, ~/vimfiles on Windows, creating missing directories,
if they do not exist yet) and put into it the following: >

  " This can't go in .vimrc, because :PatienceDiff isn't available
  if !exists(":PatienceDiff")
  " This block is optional, but will protect you from errors if you
  " uninstall vim-diff-enhanced or share your config across machines
    finish
  endif
  PatienceDiff
<

3. EnhancedDiff configuration                              *EnhancedDiff-config*
==============================================================================

You can tweak the arguments for the diff generating tools using the following
variables:

g:enhanced_diff_default_git
---------------------------
Default command line arguments for git
(Default: "--no-index --no-color --no-ext-diff")

g:enhanced_diff_default_args
----------------------------
Default arguments for any diff command
(Default: "-U0")

g:enhanced_diff_default_<command>
---------------------------------
Default command line argument for <command> (e.g. use "hg" to specify special
arguments and you want to use hg to generate the diff)
(Default: unset)

                                                    *EnhancedDiff-custom-cmd*

Suppose you want to use a different command line tool to generate the diff.

For example, let's say you want to use mercurial to generate your diffs.
First define the g:enhanced_diff_default_hg variable and set it to
include all required arguments: >

    :let g:enhanced_diff_default_hg = '-a'

Then you define your custom command to make the next time diff mode is started
make use of mercurial: >

    :com! HgDiff :let &diffexpr='EnhancedDiff#Diff("hg diff")'

The first argument of the EnhancedDiff#Diff specifies the command to use to
generate the diff. The optional second argument specifies an optional
parameter that will be used in addition to the g:enhanced_diff_default_hg
variable. In addition to the arguments from the g:enhanced_diff_default_hg
variable, also the arguments from the g:enhanced_diff_default_args will be
used (e.g. by default the -U0 to prevent generating context lines).

Note: You need to make sure to generate either a normal style diff or a
unified style diff. A unified diff will be converted to a normal style diff so
that Vim can make use of that diff for its diff mode.

                                                    *EnhancedDiff-convert-diffs*
The EnhancedDiff plugin defines a public function
(EnhancedDiff#ConvertToNormalDiff(arg) that can be used by any plugin to
convert a diff in unified form to a diff that can be read by Vim.

arg is a |List| containing the diff as returned by git diff. Use it
like this: >

    let mydiff   = systemlist('git diff ...')
    let difflist = EnhancedDiff#ConvertToNormalDiff(mydiff)
<
If your Vim doesn't have the systemlist() function, you can manully split the
list like this: >

    let mydiff   = split(system('git diff ...'), "\n")
    let difflist = EnhancedDiff#ConvertToNormalDiff(mydiff)

Note: If you want to use the converted diff and feed it back to Vim for its
diff mode, you need to write the list back to the file |v:fname_out|
