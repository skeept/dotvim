`Powerline for vim <https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline>`_
============================================================

The old vim-powerline project is deprecated and is no longer officially 
supported. It has been replaced by `a new, Python based port 
<https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline>`_. It is strongly recommended that 
you migrate to the new project as soon as possible.

Note that this branch no longer contains any compatibility code. The new 
plugin has built-in support for Vundle, see the docs for details.

-----

The old project will still be available in its current state in this repo 
(checkout the develop branch to continue using it).
