1. Intro                                                        *startify-intro*

Startify is a zero-conf plugin which shows recently used files and sessions
that were saved to a certain directory.


==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                        *startify-usage*

Startify basically provides two things:

1) If you start Vim without giving any filenames to it (or pipe stuff to it so
   it reads from STDIN), startify will show a small but pretty start screen
   which shows recently used files (using viminfo) and sessions by default.

   Additionally, you can define bookmarks, thus entries for files that always
   should be available in the start screen.

   You can either navigate to a certain menu entry or you just key in whatever
   is written between the square brackets on that line.

2) It eases handling of loading and saving sessions by only working with a
   certain directory. Two commands are used for convenience:

      :SLoad    load a session
      :SSave    save a session

The default settings are pretty sane, so it should work without any
configuration.


==============================================================================
3. Options                                                    *startify-options*

Put these variables into your vimrc. The shown assignments are also the
default values.

============-

    let g:startify_session_dir = '~/.vim/session'

The directory to save/load sessions to/from.


============-

    let g:startify_show_sessions = 1

List saved sessions in g:startify_session_dir.


============-

    let g:startify_show_files = 1

List recently used files using viminfo.


============-

    let g:startify_show_files_number = 10

The amount of files to list.


============-

    let g:startify_bookmarks = [ '~/.vimrc' ]

A list of files to bookmark. Those files will always be shown at the bottom of
the start screen.


==============================================================================
4. Commands                                                  *startify-commands*

There are only two commands for handling sessions:

    :SLoad    load a session
    :SSave    save a session

These take either 0 or 1 argument. If you don't specify the session name as an
argument, they will just ask for it.

Providing only a part of the session name works too, if you complete the
argument with either <c-u> or <tab> afterwards.
