## Introduction

gitv is a 'gitk clone' plugin for the text editor Vim. The goal is
to give you a similar set of functionality as a repository viewer.
Using this plugin you can view a repository's history including
branching and merging, you can see which commits refs point to.
You can quickly and easily view what changed to which files and
when. You can perform arbitrary diffs (using Vim's excellent built
in diff functionality) and you can easily check out whole commits
and branches or just individual files if need be.

Throw in the fact that it is running in Vim and you get for free:
the ability to move over repository history quickly and precisely
using Vim's built in movement operators. You get excellent code
syntax highlighting due to Vim's built in ability. You can open up
all sorts of repository views in multiple windows and position
them exactly how you like. You can take advantage of Vim's
registers to copy multiple fragments of code from previous
commits. The list goes on.

Start the plugin by running :Gitv in Vim when viewing a file in a git repository.

This plugin is an extension of the [tpope/fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) plugin.

I hope you like it!

## Installation

Install in ~/.vim, or in ~\vimfiles if you're on Windows. This
plugin should be fully compatible with any plugin managers that
support git if you want to install it this way.

gitv was developed against Vim 7.3 and later 8.0 but earlier
versions of Vim should work.  Vim 7.2+ is recommended as it
ships with syntax highlighting for many Git file types.
**You will also need the
[tpope/fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) plugin installed and working for gitv to work.**
