My vim configuration.

Bellow are some tips (things I need to look up once in a while)


"xY -- copies the current line to register x
"xP -- pastes the content of register x before the cursor

ma -- mark the current position in mark a
'a -- goto the position specified in mark a

H M L -- goto to the [H]top, [M]midle, or [L]bottom of the current screen

zz -- put the current cursor position in the midle of the screen

recording -- to record a set of keystrokes to register s do the folowing:
qs<keystrokes>q
then invoke the keystroke s by @s

ZQ : quit without asking for confirmation


tranposing chars: xp
transposing lines: ddp
transposing words: dawwP

<c-o> -- goto last visited position in the file
<c-i> -- usually goes back, but after mapping <tab> to <c-w> have defined :Jump command

change case of current character: ~
current line <lowercase-uppercase>: uu UU
in visual mode: u and U change the case of selected text
guaw -- change current word lowercase
gUaw -- change current word uppercase

to select various lines use <shitf-v> <c-v> selects blocks

replace ^M
:%s/<ctrl-v><enter>//g

change to current folder of current file
cd %:p:h

perldo
'<,'>perldo $_ .= '   ' . (abs((split(/,/, $_))[2]) > 1.0e-8 ? 'YES' : 'NO')
in the specified range append to current line $_ .= ...

@: -- repeat last : command


-- some mappings I have don't always remember --
\os -- open scratch buffer
,di -- display registers (:reg or equivalently :di)
q; :
q' "
\rs -- start recording to register u
\re -- end recording. Contents in register u
,co -- capture output from command (pastes contents at end of current buffer)
<c-e> (insert mode) -- either go to end of line or copy char bellow


following works currently to compile without python on windows:

search developer (a terminal should come up)
In that terminal go to the src folder where vim source is and run:
nmake -f Make_mvc.mak DYNAMIC_PYTHON3=no GUI=no
nmake -f Make_mvc.mak DYNAMIC_PYTHON3=no GUI=yes

can adjust for lua when we try to enable that again
