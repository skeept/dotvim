Adds fuzzy capabilities to normal search in vim.

=== `:FuzzySearch`
Acts just like normal buffer searching, except with fuzzy matching between each letter. +
Space matches a series of any characters(translates to `.\{-}`)

== Matching
By default, `fuzzysearch` doesn't match over spaces. That means that `"fr"` will NOT match `"foo bar"`, but `"f r"` will.
If you dislike this behaviour, set `g:fuzzysearch_match_spaces = 1`.
The reasoning behind the default behaviour is that it is much easier to narrow down searches, in order to re-use patterns later, for example in a replacement by `:%s//<new_string>/g`.


=== Useful mappings
Replace in file using last search: `nnoremap <leader>r :%s///g<left><left>` +
I find it very useful to create a fuzzy search quickly, then replace all instances using this mapping.

=== Options
`g:fuzzysearch_prompt = 'fuzzy /'` +
`g:fuzzysearch_hlsearch = 1` +
`g:fuzzysearch_ignorecase = 1` +
`g:fuzzysearch_max_history = 30` +
`g:fuzzysearch_match_spaces = 0`
