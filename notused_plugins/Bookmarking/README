A bookmaking facility to Vim for marking points of interest.

Author: David Terei

Adds a book marking feature to Vim that allows lines of interest to be marked.
While similar to marks, you don't need to assign a bookmark to a mark key,
instead an infinite number of bookmarks can be created and then jumped
through in sequential order (by line number) with no strain on your memory.
This is great to use when you are browsing through some source code for the
first time and need to mark out places of interest to learn how it works.

The bookmark facility provides a number of new commands as well as a default
mapping of these commands to keys. This mapping can be customised as can the
bookmarks appearance.

Bookmarks can be created using the |ToggleBookmark| command. This will place a
bookmark at the current location in the file, which should be visually
visible. You can then jump around the bookmarks in a file by using the
|NextBookmark| and |PreviousBookmark| commands.
