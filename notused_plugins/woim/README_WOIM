GENERAL INFORAMTION ABOUT THE VIM PLUGIN FOR WOIM (version 1.5.0)

WOIM is a methodology to describe anything - any state, item(s), pattern,
action, process, transition, program, instruction set etc. So, you can use
it as an outliner, a ToDo list handler, a process design tool, a data
modeler, or any other way you want to describe something.

This plugin does both highlighting and various automatic handling of WOIM
lists, like collapsing lists or parts of lists in a sophisticated way.

The plugin incorporates encryption. You can encrypt any part of a WOIM
list or take advantage of the autoencryption feature by making the WOIM
list a dot file - i.e. prefixing the file name wiht a dot (such as
".test.woim"). You can use this plugin to make a password safe.

As you most certainly have already done, to install the WOIM plugin for
VIM, dowmload woim.vba and do:

  vim woim.vba
  :so %
  :q

You will then discover that this file (README_WOIM) will appear in the VIM
directory, while the documentation will be placed in the "doc"
subdirectory, the WOIM plugin will be placed in the "syntax" subdirectory.
A WOIM filetype detection file is placed in the "ftdetect" subdirectory.

From now on all files with the ".woim" file extension will be treated as a
WOIM file, syntax highlighted corrrectly and you can use all the neat WOIM
functionality for VIM.

To use WOIM lists within other file types (other than ".woim"), add the
following to those syntax files:

  syn include @WOIM ~/.vim/syntax/woim.vim
  syn region WoimSnip matchgroup=Snip start="WOIMstart" end="WOIMend" contains=@WOIM
  hi link Snip SpecialComment

The documentation file contains all of the WOIM definition and is also found here:

INSTRUCTIONS

Use tabs/shifts or * for indentations

Use <SPACE> to toggle one fold
Use \0 to \9, \a, \b, \c, \d, \e, \f to show up to 15 levels expanded

Use <leader>s to remove underlining of States (prefixed with S:)
Use <leader>S to add underlining of States (prefixed with S:)
Use <leader>t to remove underlining of Transitions (prefixed with T:)
Use <leader>T to add underlining of Transitions (prefixed with T:)

Use <leader>v to add a checkbox at start of item or to toggle a checkbox
Use <leader>V to add/toggle a checkbox with a date stamp for completion

Use "gr" (without the quotation marks, signifies "Goto Ref") while the
cursor is on a WOIM reference to jump to that destination in a WOIM list

Use <leader><SPACE> to go to the next open template element
(A template element is a WOIM item ending in an equal sign)

Use <leader>z to encrypt the current line (including all sublevels if folded)
Use <leader>Z to encrypt the current file (all lines)
Use <leader>x to decrypt the current line (mark all subsequent encrypted lines)
Use <leader>X to decrypt the current file (all lines)

If you want a WOIM list to be automatically encrypted upon saving and
decrypted upon opening it, just prefix the filename with a dot (like
".test.woim").

When using encryption in a WOIM list or for the whole file, you will be
asked for a password - twice when saving the file and once when opening
it. You must have OpenSSL in your path to take advantage of these
features.

Syntax updated at start and every time you leave Insert mode 

For this help and more, including the full WOIM definition/description, type 

  :help WOIM

If you use tab completion after the "WOIM", you will find all the help
tags in the documentation.


Enjoy.
