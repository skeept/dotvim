<!--
READ THIS FIRST: If you are experiencing any bug whatsoever dealing with
the output of linters, please use `let g:ale_history_log_output = 1` before
pasting output. It will capture the output of commands that are run.

For bugs, paste output from your clipboard after running :ALEInfoToClipboard
here. If that doesn't work for some reason, try running :ALEInfo and copying
the output from that here instead. If everything is broken, run around in
circles and scream.

Whatever the case, describe the your issue here.
