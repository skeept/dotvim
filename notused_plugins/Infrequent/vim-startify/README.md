This plugin provides a start screen for Vim and Neovim.

It provides **dynamically created headers or footers** and uses configurable
lists to show **recently used or bookmarked files** and **persistent sessions**.
All of this can be accessed in a **simple to use menu** that allows to open
single or multiple entries.

Startify doesn't get in your way and works out-of-the-box, but provides many
options for fine-grained customization.

## Installation and Documentation

Use your favorite plugin manager.

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

    Plug 'mhinz/vim-startify'

It works without any configuration, but you might want to look into the
documentation for further customization:

    :h startify
    :h startify-faq
