*tselectbuffer.txt*  A simplicistic buffer selector/switcher
                     Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

This plugin provides a simple buffer selector. It doesn't have all the 
features other buffer selectors have but can be useful for quickly 
switching to a different buffer or for deleting buffers.

The idea is to view the buffer list, to do something, and to close the 
buffer list. If you really want to permanently watch the buffer list to 
see whether it's changed, you might want to use a different plugin.

Features:
    - list buffers, dynamically filter buffers matching a pattern
    - switch to a buffer
    - rename a buffer (you may need to use :saveas! or :w! when writing 
    the renamed buffer to disk)
    - delete one or more buffer(s)

:[N]TSelectBuffer[!]
    List buffers. With a count or a !, show also hidden buffers.
    Keys:
    <cr>  ... Select (close the buffer list)
    <c-s> ... Open in split window
    <c-v> ... Open in vertically split window
    <c-t> ... Open in new tab
    <c-w> ... Show in original window (continue with the buffer list)
    <c-d> ... Delete a buffer
    <c-u> ... Rename a buffer
    <     ... Jump to opened buffer in window/tab

Suggested keymaps (put something like this into ~/.vimrc):
    noremap <m-b> :TSelectBuffer<cr>
    inoremap <m-b> <c-o>:TSelectBuffer<cr>

    If non-null, automatically pick the last item in the list. I.e. if you 
    start typing a name and there is only one item left matching that name 
    it is automatically picked and you don't have to type <cr>.
