ENABLING AND DISABLING RELATIVE NUMBERING
				*:IndGuide*
    The IndGuide (indentation guide) plugin provides a command: >
    	:IndGuide[!]
<   The :IndGuide command enables indentation guide signs
    The :IndGuide! command disables indentation guide signs

                            *:IG*
    If :IG hasn't been previously defined, then one may also use >
    	:IG
<   to toggle relative numbering.

    The IndGuide plugin reports on its enabled/disabled status with >
        indguidemode=1 : IndGuide mode is enabled
        indguidemode=0 : IndGuide mode is disabled
<    This variable is used for reporting and to control :IG based toggling.

YOUR VIM MUST HAVE SIGNS FOR THIS PLUGIN
    To use this plugin your vim must have been compiled with the "huge" feature
    set (so as to have +signs in the :version listing).  Typically that means
    having used >

    	configure --with-features=huge
<
    To determine if your copy of vim has signs, you may: >
        :echo has("signs")
<   If it shows "1", then your vim supports signs.

    Alternatively, you may inquire of vim with: >
    	:version
<   and if +signs appears in the listing, then, again, your vim supports
    signs.  If it lists -signs, then unfortunately your vim does not do so.

MODFIYING THE INDENTATION GUIDE HIGHLIGHTING
    The indenation guide signs are highlighted with >

    hi default HL_IndGuide gui=none ctermfg=gray ctermbg=black guifg=gray50 guibg=black

<   This information is provided so that you may know what to specify to use
    your preferences in indentation guide highlighting.  One way to get your
    preferred colorization in is to put lines like the following into
    .vim/after/plugin/IndGuide.vim: >

    au FileType * hi HL_IndGuide gui=none ctermfg=yellow  ctermbg=black guifg=yellow  guibg=black
<

CHANGING INDGUIDE'S SYMBOLS
    There are four symbols used by IndGuide; you may change none, any, or all
    of them by setting them in your .vimrc.  The variables are: >

        Global Variable   Symbol   Meaning
	---------------   ------   -------
    	g:indguide_more     ⍈      indentation is increasing on next line
	g:indguide_stay     │      indentation level staying the same
	g:indguide_less     ├      indentattion level has decreased
	g:indguide_stop     └      indentation level dropped to zero
<
    (the symbols make sense for fileformat utf-8)

HOW TO START WITH INDENTATION GUIDE MODE ENABLED
   Using >
    Unix: ~/.vim/after/plugin/IndGuide.vim
    Windows: $HOME\_vimfiles\after\plugin\IndGuide.vim
<  place the following line: >
    call IndGuide#IndGuideCtrl(1)
<
