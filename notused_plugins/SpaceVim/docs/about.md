# About SpaceVim

[SpaceVim](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim) is a Modular configuration, a bundle of custom settings and plugins for Vim,
here we call them layers, each layer has different plugins and config, users just need
to select the layers they need. It got inspired by [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs). If you use SpaceVim,
please star it on github. It's a great way of getting feedback and gives me the kick to
put more time into development.

If you encounter any bugs or have feature requests, just open an issue
report on Github.
