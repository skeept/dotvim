1. Intro                                                         *aurum-intro*

This plugin provides a vim <--> VCS (currently mercurial, git and subversion) 
integration for your projects. Features:
  - Partially committing changes (|:AuRecord|).
  - Viewing file state at particular revision (|aurum://file|, |:AuFile|).
  - Viewing uncommited changes in a |vimdiff|, as well as changes between 
    specific revisions (|:AuVimDiff|). It is also possible to open multiple 
    tabs with all changes to all files viewed as side-by-side diffs.
  - Viewing revisions log (|:AuLog|). Output is highly customizable.
  - Viewing working directory status (|:AuStatus|).
  - Commiting changes (|:AuCommit|), commit messages are remembered in case of 
    rollback (|g:aurum_remembermsg|).
  - Obtaining various URL’s out of remote repository URL (like URL of the HTML 
    version of the current file with URL fragment pointing to the current line 
    attached: useful for sharing) (|:AuHyperlink|). For mercurial it also 
    supports git and subversion revisions (in case you are using hg-git and 
    hgsubversion respectively).
  - |aurum#changeset()|, |aurum#repository()| and |aurum#status()| functions 
    that are to be used from modeline.
  - Frontends for various other VCS commands.
Most commands can be reached with a set of mappings (see |aurum-mappings|), 
all mappings are customizable.

Plugin’s mercurial driver is able to use mercurial python API as well as its 
CLI, but remember that the former is much slower and less tested. In order to 
use mercurial python API you must have vim compiled with |+python| (mercurial 
currently does not support python 3) and have mercurial in python’s sys.path 
(note: on windows msi installer is not adding mercurial to sys.path, so you 
won’t be able to use its python API).

Plugin requires some additional plugins:
  - frawor (https://bitbucket.org/ZyX_I/frawor)
  - (optional) ansi_esc_echo (https://bitbucket.org/ZyX_I/ansi_esc_echo)
  - (optional) one of
      - Command-T (vimscript #3025)
      - ctrlp (vimscript #3736)
      - FuzzyFinder (vimscript #1984)
      - unite (vimscript #3396)
      - ku (vimscript #2337)
      - tlib (vimscript #1863)
    for |:AuFile| prompt option and a number of OpenAny/AnnotateAny mappings.
(with their dependencies).

Note: aurum supports VAM (https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager). It 
      is prefered that you use it for aurum installation.

2. Functionality provided                                *aurum-functionality*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. Commands                                                 *aurum-commands*

There are some common things for all commands:
1. All commands are constructed using |FWC| and thus you can truncate all 
   keyword options (but only if truncated version is unambigious).
2. If some command accepts file or glob argument it is likely to be able to 
   get repository location from it, thus “repo” option is not needed (or is 
   even ignored). This also applies to options like “file”/“files”.
3. Commands accepting filenames or globs also accept “:” meaning “current 
   file”.                      *aurum-current-revision* *aurum-current-file*
4. “current file” and “current revision” are determined in the following 
   fashion:
   1. |aurum://file|:{repo}:{rev}:{file} buffers: current revision is {rev} 
      and current file is {file}.
   2. |aurum://status|: current file is file under cursor and current revision 
      is first status revision.
   3. |aurum://diff| buffers: current file is one of the files which section 
      is located under the cursor and current revision is either second or 
      first diffed revision.
   4. |aurum://annotate| buffers: current file is file under cursor (annotate 
      may follow renames/copies; target filename is not explicitely mentioned) 
      and current revision is revision under cursor.
   5. |aurum://log| buffers: current file is absent and current revision is 
      revision whose log entry you see under cursor.
   6. For other buffers: current file is file name, current revision is 
      working directory revision.

AuAnnotate [file {file}] [rev {rev}] [repo {repo}]               *:AuAnnotate*
    Annotate rev {rev} of a file {file}. By default annotates current revision 
    of a current file (|aurum-current-file|).

AuBranch[!] {branch} [repo {repo}]                                 *:AuBranch*
    Set current branch name to {branch}. Bang forces creating of the branch 
    even if it currently exists.

AuCommit {options} [glob1 [glob2 [...]]]                           *:AuCommit*
    Commit files matching given globs (current file if no globs were given). 
    If “message” option was not specified, opens |aurum://commit| buffer. You 
    can specify string “all” instead of the globs, in this case changes to all 
    tracked files will be commited (equivalent to running “!hg commit”).
    Possible options:
    Option  Description ~
    type    Either one of modified/added/removed/deleted/unknown, string 
            containing capitalized first letters of mentined status names 
            (additionally “?” for unknown and “!” for deleted), or “all” that 
            is equivalent to specifying all statuses. May be specified more 
            then once. Determines what files should be matched against given 
            globs: “AuCommit **” is equivalent to “AuCommit all”, but 
            “AuCommit type MARDU **” will also add untracked and remove 
            missing files (like “hg commit -A”). Does not affect “:AuCommit 
            all” and “:AuCommit”, latter will always add current file if it 
            was untracked.
    message Commit message.
    user    Committer.
    date    Commit date in form yy-mm-dd_HH:MM:SS. Both date and time parts 
            are optional (though you must specify one of them), you can omit 
            year or use full four-digit form. Seconds are also optional.
    [no]amend
            Flag. If set, strips working directory revision and proceeds as 
            usual for |:AuCommit|. Note: unlike “hg commit --amend” this won’t 
            preserve changes that were committed. Use “|:AuRecord| amend” to 
            preserve.
    [no]closebranch
            Flag. See description of --close-branch in “hg help commit”.
    repo    Path. Repository that should be committed to.

AuDiff {options} {diffoptions} [glob1 [...]]                         *:AuDiff*
    View differences between revisions specified in options (default: between 
    working directory state and working directory revision).
    Possible options:
    Option  Description ~
    rev1    First revision. If it is the only revision set, then AuDiff will 
            show changes made by given revision.
    rev2    Second revision. If it is the only revision set, then AuDiff will 
            show changes between working directory and given revision.
            If both revisions are given then it will compare first revision 
            against second one.
    changes Overrides rev1 and rev2. Acts just like if “rev1” is set and 
            “rev2” is not.
    cmd     Command used to open |aurum://diff| buffer.
            Default: “silent edit”.
    repo    Path. Repository where diff should be run.
                                                           *aurum-diffoptions*
    Diffoption    Description ~
    numlines      Unsigned integer. Number of context lines that should be 
                  shown.
    [no]reverse   Flag. Determines whether reversed patch should be generated.
    [no]ignorews  Flag. Determines whether whitespace characters should be 
                  ignored when comparing lines.
    [no]iwsamount Flag. Determines whether changes in amount of whitespace 
                  characters should be ignored.
    [no]iblanks   Flag. Determines whether changes consisting only of blank 
                  lines should be ignored.
    [no]showfunc  Flag. Determines whether it should be shown in which 
                  function changes were made.
    [no]alltext   Flag. Determines whether all files should be treated as text 
                  files.
    [no]dates     Flag. Determines whether dates should be shown in headers.
    [no]git       Flag. Determines whether extended git format should be used.

                                                                     *:AuFile*
AuFile [{rev} [{file}]] [[no]replace] [[no]prompt] [cmd {cmd}] [repo {repo}]
    View file as it was at given revision. If “replace” option is given, then 
    current buffer contents will be replaced instead of opening new 
    |aurum://file| buffer. “cmd” option determines which command will be used 
    to open aurum://file buffer (default: “silent edit”) (may be overriden by 
    “replace” option).
    If you need to skip to keyword arguments use “:” in place of file and 
    revision: in this case these arguments are considered to be absent.
    If “prompt” option is given then {file} is treated as a glob and prompt is 
    used to get what file should be actually opened.
    Note: You may use “{pat1,pat2}” to merge multiple globs into one and “:” 
          as an equivalent for “all files” or “**”. Also see |aurum-globs|.

AuGrep {pattern} {opts}                                              *:AuGrep*
    Populates |quickfix| list with the results of searching repository for 
    given {pattern} ({pattern} syntax is determined by used VCS). If any globs 
    are given, then only files matching these globs are searched.
    Possible options:
    Option         Description ~
    [no]ignorecase Flag. Determines whether case should be ignored.
    revrange       Accepts two revisions as arguments. Adds revisions between 
                   given ones to the list of revisions that should be searched 
                   for. May be specified more then once.
    revision       Accepts one revision. Adds it to the list of revisions that 
                   should be searched for. May be specified more then once.
    files          Glob. Determines which files should be searched. May be 
                   specified more then once.
    location       Number from the range 0 .. winnr('$') (|winnr()|). If this 
                   argument is specified, AuGrep will use |location-list| for 
                   the given window (current in case it is 0) instead of the 
                   quickfix list.
    repo           Path. Repository that should be searched.
    [no]wdfiles    Flag. Determines whether :AuGrep should output files in 
                   working directory if they have not changed since found 
                   revision. Overrides |g:aurum_workdirfiles|.
    [no]workmatch  Flag. When processing “files” option if this flag is true 
                   (default) it will grep only files present in working 
                   directory changeset. If this flag is false, :AuGrep will 
                   process all changesets in order to find out files matching 
                   pattern(s) given in “files” option.

[range]AuHyperlink {opts}                                       *:AuHyperlink*
    Constructs a URL and puts it into system clipboard (see |quote+|).
    Possible options:
    Option    Description ~
    rev       Revision that is to be refered. Defaults:
                  URL types                   Default ~
                  html,raw,annotate,filehist  |aurum-current-revision|
                  bundle,changeset            working directory revision
                  log                         same as above, but mainly ignored
                  clone,push                  not applicable (not used)
              Note: Depending on specific repository this argument may be 
                    unsupported (mostly hgsubversion repositories), supported 
                    only partly (mostly hg-git repositories: supported only if 
                    revision in question has first bookmark mapping to git 
                    branch) or under specific conditions (kenai.com requires 
                    revision numbers matching in your and remote repository).
    file      File that is to be refered (url=html,raw,annotate,filehist).
              Default: see |aurum-current-file|.
    url       URL type. Accepted types (default: html):         *aurum-ho-url*
                  Type      Description ~
                  html      URL of the file, HTML formatted
                  raw       URL of the file, raw bundle
                  annotate  URL of the file, annotated
                  filehist  URL of the file history
                  bundle    URL of the repository snapshot
                  changeset URL of the changeset (usually, diff)
                  log       URL of the commit log
                  clone     URL of the repository, read-only
                  push      URL of the repository, read-write
    [no]line  Determines whether URL fragment refering to given line should be 
              added to the URL and what line  should it refer to.
              Only for url=file and url=annotate.
              Default: not added unless range is other then default (e.g. the 
              whole file), in which case the only line of the range is used 
              (case when first line is not equal to last line is described 
              below).
    [no]lines Like above, but URL fragment now is assumed to point to a line 
              range (and thus you should use “lines 5 7”: with two numbers). 
              From what I know, only github supports this feature. Is used 
              automatically if first line of the range is not equal to the 
              last line.
    cmd       Command that is used to copy url to register.
              Default: "let @+=%s". Do not forget to escape spaces.
              Value of this option is used in this fashion: >
                execute printf(cmd, string(URL))
<   repo      Path. Repository that should be used.

    Note: you can extend list of supported remote repositories by using 
          |g:aurum_hypsites| option.

AuJunk [forget] [ignore] [remove] [ignoreglobs] glob1 [...]          *:AuJunk*
    Forget, ignore or remove (default: remove) files matching given globs 
    (specify “:” to act on current file). With “ignoreglobs” it will ignore 
    not matching files, but given globs. Unlike other commands you must 
    specify at least one glob (or “:”) here, without this it will fail.
    Note: It won’t touch untracked files unless “ignore” option was specified.

AuLog [{repo}] {options} {diffoptions}                                *:AuLog*
    Open buffer with changeset log. For {diffoptions} see |aurum-diffoptions|.
    Possible options:
    Option      Description ~
    files       Glob. If present, only revisions where file matching glob was 
                modified are shown. It also tracks renames and copies of 
                a file. May be specified more then once.
                Note: This option also affects files shown when “stat”, 
                      “patch”, “showfiles”, “showrenames” and “showcopies” 
                      options are specified (unless |aurum-lo-ignfiles| is

    date        String of a form y-m-d_H:M where all components except first 
                are optional. Each of y, m, d, H, M may be either a number, 
                a dot (meaning put current value here) and a star (meaning 
                “any”). “y” is either a four- or two-digit year. If present, 
                selects revisions that match given date. You can also use 
                “>={date}”, “<={date}” and “{date1}<=>{date2}” (“=” may be 
                omitted).

    [no]limit   Number (1 to inf). Shows at most {limit} revisions, starting 
                from the tip. Use “nolimit” to disable limit. Overrides 
                |g:aurum_loglimit|.
    [no]autoaddlog
                Flag. Overrides |g:aurum_autoaddlog|.
    revision    Revision. Shows only specified revision.
    revrange    Two revisions. Shows revisions that are between specified 
                ones.
    [no]merges  Flag. “merges” selects revisions with more then one parent, 
                “nomerges” selects revisions that have one or no parents.
    style       String. Specifies template name, see |aurum-logstyles|.
    template    Variable name. Specifies variable from which template should 
                be loaded.
                                                           *aurum-lo-ignfiles*
    ignfiles    One of “patch”, “renames”, “copies”, “files”, “diff”, 
                “mappings”. May be specified more then once. Overrides 
                |g:aurum_ignorefiles|. Determines when “files” option will be 
                ignored:
                  Value    Description ~
                  patch    “patch” and “stat” will always show full changeset 
                           patch or statistics.
                  renames  “showrenames” will always show all renamed files.
                  copies   “showcopies” will always show all copied files.
                  files    “showfiles” will always show all changed files.
                  diff     AuLog Fdiff, RFdiff, FVdiff and RFVdiff mappings 
                           will show changes done to all changed files.
                  open     AuLog Diff, Rdiff, Vdiff, RVdiff, File, Open and 
                           Annotate mappings will show all changed files in 
                           file selection dialog.
    cmd         Command. Determines which command should be used to open log.
                Default: “silent new”.
    [no]stat    Flag. Determines whether summary of changes should be shown.
    [no]patch   Flag. Determines whether revision patch should be shown.
    [no]showfiles
                Flag. Determines whether list of files changed in given 
                revision should be shown.
    [no]showcopies
                Flag. Determines whether copies should be shown.
    [no]showrenames
                Flag. Determines whether renames should be shown.
    [no]procinput
                Flag. Overrides |g:aurum_procinput|: determines whether user 
                input will be processed while generating log.
                Note If enabled, acts like g:aurum_procinput=2.
    [no]progress
                Flag. Overrides |g:aurum_showprogress|: determines whether 
                progress bar should be shown in the statusline while 
                generating log.

                                                                     *:AuMove*
AuMove [copy] [rightrepl] [leftpattern] [pretend] [repo {repo}] [args ...]
    Move (with “copy” option: copy) files. Depending on number and type of 
    arguments it can be one of the following:
    - No arguments: move current file to current directory.
    - One argument that is a name of existing directory: move current file to 
      given directory.
    - At least two arguments with “rightrepl” option given: capture parts of 
      filenames matching wildcards and use last argument as the replacement 
      string (see |substitute()|). Example: >
          AuMove rightrepl **.txt \\1.doc
            file.txt     -> file.doc
            dir/file.txt -> dir/file.doc
<   - At least two arguments with “leftpattern” option given: take all 
      arguments except last as a pattern and use the last argument as 
      replacement string (see |substitute()|). Example: >
          AuMove leftpattern \\v^(.*)\\.txt$ \\1.doc
            file.txt     -> file.doc
            dir/file.txt -> dir/file.doc
<     Note that this is the only case when paths are assumed to be relative to 
           repository root. In any other cases they are assumed to be relative 
           to current directory.
    - Two arguments containing at least one star or question mark which both 
      have just the same number of unescaped stars and/or question marks 
      arranged in the same order. In this case it acts like “zmv -W”: parts of 
      filename matching wildcards are captured (note vim allows only up to 
      9 capturing groups), and each wildcard in the right argument is replaced 
      by the match: >
          AuMove **.txt **.doc
            file.txt     -> file.doc
            dir/file.txt -> dir/file.doc
<     Note that “AuMove */*.txt **.doc” won’t work.
    - Two or more arguments with last one that is a name of existing 
      directory: move files matching given patterns (all arguments but the 
      last one) to given directory (last argument).
      You may also specify unexisting directory with trailing forward slash. 
      In this case it will be created.
    - One or more arguments that have not matched any of the above rules: move 
      files matching given patterns (patterns are all arguments) to the 
      current directory.
    If “pretend” option is given :AuMove won’t actually do anything, just 
    print what it will do (relative to repository root, not to current 
    directory).
    Note: you must either be at repository root (see |:cd|) or have all 
          arguments look like “path/to/repository/{meaningfulPart}”.

AuName[!] {name} {opts} [{rev}]                                      *:AuName*
    Name (tag/bookmark/...) revision {rev} (default: working directory 
    revision) as {name}. If bang is given, then force naming even if {name} 
    already exists. Possible options:
    Option      Description ~
    type        String, determines what will be done. Depends on repository 
                object, for mercurial repositories it will be likely “tag” or 
                “bookmark”.
                Default: first item present in |aurum-repo.labeltypes|.
    [no]delete  Flag. If enabled, then {rev} argument will be ignored and 
                tag/bookmark/... will be deleted. Default: disabled.
    [no]local   Flag. If enabled, then name will not be pushed.
                Default: disabled.
    repo        Path. Repository that should be operated upon.

AuOther[!] {action} [{rev}[ {url}[ {repo}]]]                        *:AuOther*
    Push, pull or view what will be pushed or pulled. {rev} determines 
    revision to be pushed/pulled, {url} determines where it should be pushed 
    to/pulled from. If bang is present, then push even to unrelated 
    repositories. Use ":" instead of any optional argument to get the same 
    behavior as if it was not specified.
    Possible actions:
    Action    Description ~
    push      Push
    pull      Pull
    outgoing  View what will be pushed if you replace “outgoing” with “push”
    incoming  View what will be pulled if you replace “incoming” with “pull”

AuRecord {opts} [glob1 [...]]                                      *:AuRecord*
    Start record tab (|aurum-record|). Possible options are just the same as 
    |:AuCommit| has (except for “type” option that is absent).
    Note: `AuRecord amend` preserves changes from previous commit.

AuStatus [{repo}] {opts}                                           *:AuStatus*
    Display status of the repository. Possible options:
    Option  Description ~
    files   Glob. If given, only status of files that match given glob will be 
            displayed. May be specified more then once.
    rev     Revision. If given :AuStatus will display status not relative to 
            working revision, but to the given one. If “wdrev” is specified, 
            then it will display status as if {wdrev} was working directory 
            state and current working directory was revision from repository.
    wdrev   Revision. If given :AuStatus will display status as if {wdrev} was 
            working directory state.
    changes Revision. Works like specifying {changes} as “rev” option and its 
            first parent as “wdrev” option. Overrides “rev” and “wdrev” 
            options.
    show    Either one of modified/added/removed/deleted/unknown/ignored/clean 
            or string containing capitalized first letters of mentined status 
            names (additionally “?” for unknown and “!” for deleted). May be 
            specified more then once. Determines files with what statuses 
            should be displayed. Default: modified, added, removed, deleted, 
            unknown. You can also specify “all” instead of statuses, it will 
            act as “show MARDUIC”.
    cmd     Command. Determines which command should be used to open 
            |aurum://status| buffer. Default: “silent botright new”. If 
            specified, |g:aurum_usestatwin| option has no effect and status 
            window also won’t be resized.

AuTrack[!] [glob1 [...]]                                            *:AuTrack*
    Make files matching given globs be tracked by VCS (current file if no 
    globs were given). You can also specify “:” instead of one of the globs to 
    track current file name. Adding “!” is equivalent to passing “--force” to 
    the underlying VCS.
    Note that this command matches files that has unknown and removed status, 
    so it won’t make ignored files tracked.

AuUpdate[!] [{rev} [{repo}]]                                       *:AuUpdate*
    Update working directory state to revision {rev}. With “!” it will ignore 
    uncommited changes (really it is specifying “--force” to the underlying 
    VCS).

AuVimDiff {opts} [rev1 [...]]                                     *:AuVimDiff*
    Opens a vimdiff windows. Possible options:
    Option       Description ~
    file         File to be opened. Default: |aurum-current-file|.
                 Not used when “full” option is enabled.
    files        Pattern, determines files to be opened. Default: all files.
                 Not used when “full” option is disabled.
                 Note: each pattern must contain at least one non-word 
                       character (|/\W|).
    [no]curfile  Determines whether current state of the file should be used.
    [no]usewin   Overrides |g:aurum_vimdiffusewin|. Determines whether new 
                 window should be opened instead of using existing one. First 
                 file will always be opened in current window unless “full” is 
                 enabled.
    [no]full     If enabled, opens multiple tabs containing all files changed 
                 between selected revisions (revisions and working directory 
                 state if “curfile” is enabled). Overrides “file” option, 
                 makes |g:aurum_vimdiffusewin| and “usewin” options not 
                 applicable.
    [no]onlymodified
                 Determines whether removed and added files should be included 
                 in the full diff (default: not included: option enabled).
    [no]untracked
                 Determines whether untracked (deleted and unknown) files 
                 should be included in the full diff (default: no) in addition 
                 to tracked ones.
                 Disables “onlymodified” option.
    repo         Path. Repository that should be used.

    Note: if less then two revisions (or one revision and “curfile”) were 
          specified, one will be working directory state or current revision 
          (see |aurum-current-revision|) and second (unless one revision is 
          specified) will either be working directory revision or, if it is 
          equal to current revision, its first parent.
    Note: |:AuVimDiff| and all *VDiff mappings respect value of 'diffopt' just 
          like |:diffsplit| does: if it contains “vertical” split will be 
          vertical, otherwise horizontal. Do not ask to change this as 
          |vimdiff| uses vertical splits by default: I am consistent with 
          |:diffsplit|, not with |vimdiff| as most of time |:diffsplit| is 
          being used directly; it is not used only when using existing window 
          (|g:aurum_vimdiffusewin|) and opening full vimdiff.
                          *g:frawormap_AuVimDiff* *g:frawormap_AuVimDiff_Exit*
    :AuVimDiff command defines Exit mappings for all opened buffers. By 
    default lhs of this mapping is “X” with leader “<Leader>” (“<Leader>X”), 
    but this can be customized using g:frawormap_AuVimDiff and 
    g:frawormap_AuVimDiff_Exit variables. This mapping will disable diff, 
    close (and, possibly, wipe out) opened buffers and try to restore view 
    state of the first buffer (unless it was opened by :AuVimDiff).

2.2. Functions                                               *aurum-functions*

aurum#repository :: () -> repo                            *aurum#repository()*
    Returns a repository object. Cached (update time is controlled by 
    |g:aurum_repocachetime|). See |aurum-repository|.

aurum#changeset :: ([{repo}]) -> changeset                 *aurum#changeset()*
    Returns a working directory changeset object. Cached (update time is 
    controlled by |g:aurum_cscachetime|). See |aurum-changeset|.

aurum#status :: ([{repo}]) -> status                          *aurum#status()*
    Returns a current file status (one of the keys of a dictionary returned by 
    |aurum-rf-status|) or empty string. Cached (update time is controlled by 
    |g:aurum_statuscachetime|).
    Note: if returned status is an empty string it may indicate that there it 
          failed to get status as well as that this file was not modified.
    Note 2: if vim was compiled with |+python| support this function may 
            launch a separate process which won’t be stopped until current 
            buffer is no longer visible.

aurum#branch :: ([{repo}]) -> branch                          *aurum#branch()*
    Returns a current branch name (uses |aurum-rf-getrepoprop|). Should be 
    faster then using |aurum#changeset()| and getting “branch” key from 
    returned changeset. Cached (update time is controlled by 
    |g:aurum_branchcachetime|).
    Note: if vim was compiled with |+python| support this function may launch 
          a separate process which won’t be stopped until all buffers where it 
          was called which hold files in one repository are no longer visible. 
          Only one process is launched for one repository.

aurum#currev :: {ret} -> hex | rev | cs                       *aurum#currev()*
    Depending on {ret} argument returns something that belongs to current 
    revision (|aurum-current-revision|):
    {ret}  Returns ~
    hex    Current revision unique identifier. |aurum-cs.hex|
    rev    Current revision shortened identifier. |aurum-cs.rev|
    cs     Current revision changeset dictionary. |aurum-changeset|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3. aurum:// pseudo-protocol                                       *aurum://*

Aurum provides a number of commands that can be opened or read using filenames 
starting with aurum://. Some things you should know:
- If pseudo-protocol supports more then one argument, in all but last 
  arguments colons and backslashes should be escaped. In a last argument you 
  may not escape anything (unless this argument is an options dictionary).
- While all commands take filenames relative to current directory, all 
  pseudo-protocols should be passed filenames relative to repository root.
- None of pseudo-protocols accepts globs outside of {opts}.
- When stated that {opts} are the same as used by some command it does not 
  mean that you can truncate options or use “no{option}” version. Truncations 
  are not allowed and flags should look like “{option}:1” or “{option}:0”. Two 
  subsequent options look like “{o1}:{v1},{o2}:{v2}”. Options that accept 
  lists or more then one argument will look like “{o}:{v1};{v2};...”. To 
  include semicolon here it should be escaped. You should also escape commas, 
  backslashes and colons. If command accepts {diffopts} then they can also be 
  added.
  Options “cmd” and “repo” are always ignored.
- All arguments for all pseudo-protocols are assumed to be escaped in the 
  following fashion:
                 Char  Esc ~
                    %  %%
                    ,  %c
                    :  %.
                    ;  %s
                    /  %-
                    \  %+
                  [,]  %b, %B
                  {,}  %f, %F
                    *  %a
                    ?  %q
                    `  %'
                    $  %d
  You must escape only argument delimiters (colon for most arguments, colon 
  and comma for non-list option arguments, colon, semicolon and comma for list 
  option arguments) and percent sign, but in this case you may run into 
  trouble: for example, “*” produces |E480| (no match) error on windows 
  because it can’t be escaped with backslash which is path separator.
- All mappings are created using |frawor-f-mapgroup.add| and thus can 
  customized using |g:frawormap_mgid| and |g:frawormap_mgid_mapname|.
- All buffers that define mappings also define Exit mapping (with default 
  LHS=X)
- OpenAny/AnnotateAny mappings require one of Command-T, Ctrlp, FuzzyFinder, 
  unite, ku or tlib plugins installed. Otherwise they will show |inputlist()| 
  that is unusable with large number of files.
  Note: currently if you install two or all of them the behavior is undefined 
        (depends on how keys “commandt”, “ctrlp” and “fuf” are arranged inside 
        a |Dictionary|).

aurum://annotate:{repo}:{rev}:{file}                        *aurum://annotate*

    Annotate  a   Reannotate file using current revision (only if both 
                  annotate and annotated buffers are open)
    Open      o   Open file from current revision (if both annotate and 
                  annotated buffers are open: and annotate it)
    Update    U   Update working directory to current revision.
                  Accepts count: {count}=3: update to first parent of first 
                  parent of current revision
    Next      K   Reannotate file using first child of annotated revision.
                  Accepts count, in this case first child is taken {count} 
                  times ({count}=2: first child of first child)
    Prev      J   Reannotate file using first parent of annotated revision.
                  Accepts count, in this case first parent is taken {count} 
                  times ({count}=2: first parent of first parent)
    NextMod  gK   Like above Next mapping, but children are taken until it 
                  does not find revision where file was changed. {count}=2 
                  means two changes after, not two children before.
    PrevMod  gJ   Like above Prev mapping, but parents are taken until it does 
                  not find revision where file was changed. {count}=2 means 
                  two changes before, not two parents before.

    Note These mappings are defined for aurumannotate filetype.

aurum://commit:{repo}:{user}:{date}:{closebranch}:{files}     *aurum://commit*
    Open buffer that prompts for a commit message. Writing this buffer will 
    record the commit and close the buffer. It is the only pseudo-protocol 
    type you can’t use this with |:read|.

                                                           *g:frawormap_Aurum*

All mappings (not only global) are created using |frawor-f-mapgroup.add| and 
thus can customized using |g:frawormap_mgid| and |g:frawormap_mgid_mapname|. 
For global mappings mgid=Aurum, default leader is “<Leader>a”. Unlike other 
mappings (which call internal functions), global ones call one of :Au* 
commands. Present mappings:

                      *g:frawormap_Aurum_Commit* *g:frawormap_Aurum_CommitAll*
                      *g:frawormap_Aurum_Open*   *g:frawormap_Aurum_Revert*

The following mappings use aurum#* functions and are prefixless by default. 
They are defined for command and insert modes.

2.5. Local mappings index                               *aurum-mappings-index*

Here is an index of mappings defined for various aurum://* buffers, aurum* 
filetypes or by :Au* commands. All mappings for readonly buffers have no 
leader, for non-readonly buffers or for global scope (|:AuVimDiff| ones) have 
“<leader>” as their prefix by default.

4. Options                                                     *aurum-options*

All options used by aurum are obtained using |frawor-f-getoption| and thus you 
can write g:aurumOptions.option instead of g:aurum_option. All options are 
also global-local: you can also define an option for the current buffer using 
buffer-local b:aurum_option (b:aurumOptions.option) variable.

                              *g:aurum_branchcachetime*  *g:aurum_cscachetime*
*cachetime                   *g:aurum_statuscachetime* *g:aurum_repocachetime*
    Unsigned integer, defines time since last cache update after which cache 
    will become invalid. Time is specified in seconds.
    Type    Default  Used by ~
    branch     2     |aurum#branch()|
    cs         3     |aurum#changeset()|
    status     5     |aurum#status()|
    repo       7     |aurum#repository()|, all completion functions

ignorefiles                                              *g:aurum_ignorefiles*
    List containing 0 or more strings. Determines when “files” option given to 
    |:AuLog| (or to |aurum://log|) should be ignored. See |aurum-lo-ignfiles|.
    Default: empty.

closelogwindow                                        *g:aurum_closelogwindow*
    Bool. Determines whether log window should be closed when executing 
    mappings (except mappings that add a filter and exit mapping).
    Default: 1.

procinput                                                  *g:aurum_procinput*
    0, 1 or 2. If not zero, consumes and passes user input to |:normal| while 
    generating a log thus allowing you to navigate it while it is being 
    created. Value 1 will make logger additionally check whether there were 
    some characters in input buffer before creation of log started. If there 
    were characters, then processing user input will be disabled (because in 
    other case it will possibly break mappings that do not expect such 
    behavior from |:AuLog|).
    Default value: 1.
    Note: if you somehow switch buffers while log is being generated then 
          buffer with generated log will be wiped out, log generation will 
          stop.
    Note: Input is processed between generating two revisions. As generator is 
          normally much faster then you, then you are limited to single 
          character commands. There is a hack though that allows you to bypass 
          this problem:
            Input    Action ~
            g, z, y, `, ', m, [, ], @, q, Z, <C-w>, t, T, f, F
                     Waits until you type next character
            /, ?, :, !
                     Waits until you type <CR> ("\r" or "\n") or <Esc>
            1-9      Waits until you type next non-digit
            "        Waits until you type two characters
            Part of {lhs} (|mapcheck()| returns non-empty for given character)
                     Waits until |maparg()| also returns non-empty string, 
                     |mapcheck()| returns empty string or 'timeoutlen' 
                     milliseconds passed (latter only if 'timeout' is set and 
                     vim is compiled with |+float| and |+reltime| features).

autoaddlog                                                *g:aurum_autoaddlog*
    Bool. Determines whether in |aurum://log| buffers new changesets should be 
    added when user is near the end of currently displayed log.
    Note: At least |g:aurum_loglimit| (or limit added at cmdline) revisions 
    (all if it is 0) will be shown in any case.
    Default: 1 (it does not make sense when loglimit is 0 though).

showprogress                                            *g:aurum_showprogress*
    Bool. Determines whether progress bar should be shown in statusline by 
    default.
    Default: 0.

loglimit                                                    *g:aurum_loglimit*
    Natural number or 0. Determines, how many revisions should be shown by 
    default (0 stands for “all”).
    Default: 0.

recheight                                                  *g:aurum_recheight*
    VimL |expression| that evaluates to unsigned integer or unsigned integer. 
    Determines height of status window shown in record tab (|aurum-record|).
    Default: winheight/5 (in empty tab |winheight()| will return roughly the 
             same value as 'lines').

recautowrite                                            *g:aurum_recautowrite*
    Boolean. Determines whether files opened for editing should be 
    automatically written on |BufWinLeave| and |BufLeave| events in record tab 
    (|aurum-record|) (only files in top left window are supported; others are 
    not modifiable anyway).
    See |aurum-m-AuRecord_Edit|.
    Default: 1.

fullundo                                                    *g:aurum_fullundo*
    Boolean. Determines whether full undo tree should be kept for status 
    window. With this option you will be able to undo changes done while using 
    |aurum-m-AuRecord_Edit| and redo them (note: changes are atomic: undo 
    information for edited files is not kept and all changes done during 
    editing are squashed in one change no matter how often do you save). 
    Without this option each time you use |aurum-m-AuRecord_Edit| undo history 
    is discarded. This option keeps edited version in memory thus set it to 
    true if you use |:AuRecord| to partially commit large files.
    Default: 1.

diffopts                                                    *g:aurum_diffopts*
    Dictionary. For possible keys see |aurum-diffoptions| (no truncations are 
    allowed, flags should be turned into “{option : 0}” for “nooption”, 
    “{option : 1}” for “option”).
    Default: empty.

usestatwin                                                *g:aurum_usestatwin*
    Bool. Determines whether sequential calls to |:AuStatus| with same 
    arguments should use existing status window or open a new one.
    Default: 1.

statwincmd                                                *g:aurum_statwincmd*
    String, one of “j”, “k”, “h”, “l”, “w”, “W”, “t”, “b”, “p”, “c”.
    Determines what window should be switched to when running |aurum://status| 
    mappings. See |window-move-cursor| for the description of most keys.
    No error will be given if there is no window in desired direction, 
    mappings will just use status buffer’s own window.
    Value “c” is special: window will be |:close|d and cursor will be moved to 
    whatever window vim selects. In other cases status window won’t be closed.
    Ignored if there is only one window left.
    Default: “c”.

commitinfowincmd                                    *g:aurum_commitinfowincmd*
    String, one of “j”, “k”, “h”, “l”, “w”, “W”, “t”, “b”, “p”, “s”, “v”, 
    “largest_vertical”, “largest_horizontal”, “largest_adjacent”, “largest”. 
    Determines what window should be switched to when running 
    |aurum-m-AuCommit_Diff| and |aurum-m-AuCommit_Fdiff| mappings. See 
    |window-move-cursor| and |open-window| for the description of the keys. 
    Values, beginning with “largest_” are special: they select the largest 
    window out of vertical, horizontal or all four directions respectively. 
    The largest is determined by comparing |winwidth()|*|winheight()|, window 
    width in this formula is capped with 80 columns.
    Ignored when commit is done from |aurum-record| mode, in this case diff 
    always opens in left window.
    Default: “largest_adjacent”.

commitautoopendiff                                *g:aurum_commitautoopendiff*
    Bool. Determines whether diff should be opened when commit window is 
    created. Uses |g:aurum_commitinfowincmd| to determine where diff should be 
    opened. Opened diff will be automatically closed when commit buffer is 
    closed.
    Default: 0.

remembermsg                                              *g:aurum_remembermsg*
    Bool. Determines whether message typed in commit buffer should be saved 
    when commit is performed in case of rollback. This message will appear in 
    commit buffer if you do |:AuCommit| and tip revision hash is equal to hash 
    of tip revision saved after previous |:AuCommit| run.
    Default: 1.
                                                   *g:AuPreviousCommitMessage*
                                      *g:AuPreviousTip* *g:AuPreviousRepoPath*
    Note that this option determines whether message should be saved, not 
         whether it should be restored. Message will be restored from 
         g:AuPreviousCommitMessage variable if repository path is equal to 
         g:AuPreviousRepoPath and tip revision hash is equal to 
         g:AuPreviousTip. It does not matter who set these variables and what 
         is the value of “remembermsg” option.

bufleaveremembermsg                              *g:aurum_bufleaveremembermsg*
    Bool. Determines whether message typed in commit buffer should be saved 
    when message buffer is left excluding the case when buffer is left after 
    commit is done. See note under |g:AuPreviousCommitMessage|.
    Default: 1.

vimdiffusewin                                          *g:aurum_vimdiffusewin*
    Bool. Determines whether |:AuVimDiff| should use existing window. Existing 
    window will be used if it is located to the left or right ('diffopt' 
    contains “vertical”) or below or above ('diffopt' does not contain 
    “vertical”) current window and has just the same vertical or horizontal 
    size (vertical if 'diffopt' contains “vertical”, horizontal otherwise).
    Default: 0.

workdirfiles                                            *g:aurum_workdirfiles*
    Bool. Determines whether |:AuGrep| should output files in working 
    directory if they have not changed since revision found.
    Default: 1.

hypsites                                                    *g:aurum_hypsites*
    List of pairs, just like |aurum-repo.hypsites|. Defines additional 
    repository information in case some repository support is not/can not be 
    added to the aurum.
    Values of this option are checked before |aurum-repo.hypsites|.

The following options are driver-specific:

hg_useshell                                              *g:aurum_hg_useshell*
    List (either true list or string with values separated by anything that is 
    not a lowercase letter) of Mercurial commands that are to be called 
    without using Mercurial Python API.

    Functions supporting this option: |aurum-rf-commit|, |aurum-rf-update|, 
    |aurum-rf-move| (uses "rename" mercurial command), |aurum-rf-copy|, 
    |aurum-rf-forget|, |aurum-rf-remove|, |aurum-rf-add|, |aurum-rf-branch|, 
    |aurum-rf-label| (uses "tag" or "bookmark" Mercurial commands), 
    |aurum-rf-phase|. Every function except |aurum-rf-move| and 
    |aurum-rf-label| uses Mercurial command identical to its name.

git_maxitercsnum                                    *g:aurum_git_maxitercsnum*
    Unsigned (non-negative) integer, must be less then a number of arguments 
    that can be accepted by a shell command. Determines information about how 
    many revisions will be obtained by |aurum-rf-getchangesets| and 
    |aurum-rf-revrange| functions and also how many revisions will be 
    processed by |aurum-repo.iterfuncs|. Zero means that all revisions will be 
    pulled at once, don’t use this if you are working with large repositories.
    Note: Setting it to non-zero produces extra shell call used to obtain list 
          of revisions to show. Setting it to zero increases memory 
          consumption, the time in which first log entry can be shown and may 
          increase the time needed to create full log.
    Default: 1000.

==============================================================================
5. Globs                                                         *aurum-globs*

Globs used by aurum are similar to globs used by mercurial, but have different 
implementation: they are transformed into vim regular expressions that are 
then applied to a list of filenames in normalized form (path/to/file: path 
comoponents are separated by exactly one forward slash, used path is relative 
to repository root). Supported metacharacters:
Meta  Regex     Description ~
**    .*        Like “*” below, but also match inside subdirectories
*     [^/]*     Matches any number of any characters in given directory
?     [^/]      Matches exactly one character in given directory
[!ab] [^ab]     Matches any character that is neither a nor b (see |/[]|)
[ab]  [ab]      Matches a or b (see |/[]|)
{a,b} \(a\|b\)  Matches a or b. Unlike [ab], {a,b} treats a and b as globs

==============================================================================
6. Log templates                                          *aurum-logtemplates*

Log template is a list of NL-separated lines. Inside a string only two 
characters are special: newline and $. First designates that here new line 
should be started. Second designates that next word should be replaced with 
appropriate value. You can pass additional arguments using ${word}#{args}# 
syntax where {args} is {positional1},{positional2},...,{keyword}:{value},...
Accepted {keyword}s are
Keyword    Description ~
flbeg      For multiline template strings: determine what string should be 
           prepended to the first line.
expr       Use this expression instead of default to get resulting string. 
           Inside an expression
           String  What it refers to ~
           @@@     original data
           @N@     Nth positional parameter (count starts from zero)
           @-@     number of leading colums taken by graph lines
           @.@     current |aurum-changeset| object
           @:@     current |aurum-repository| object
           @o@     current options dictionary
           @<@     (for complex multiline statement only) string that should 
                   be prepended to every line
synreg     Pass this regular expression to “syn match”. Useful if you override 
           output of the {word} using “expr” keyword.
pref, suf  For some single-line statements (currently: rev, parents, children, 
           tags, bookmarks and branch): if result of evaluating {word} is 
           non-empty (for branch: is not equal to "default") add value of the 
           argument before (pref) or after (suf) the {word}.
Number of positional parameters is fixed and depends on {word}. You can escape 
“#” if you need it included into one of parameters. You should also escape 
backslash, colon (unless it separates {keyword} from value) and comma (unless 
it separates arguments).

Generator created after parsing templates throws away lines that contain only 
one {word} that is “parents”, “children”, “tags”, “bookmarks”, “files” or 
“changes” if it expands to an empty string.

Multiline {word}s have two types:
1. Simple multiline: line beginnings are added by generator.
2. Complex multiline: line beginnings are added by expression (using @<@).

When multiline {word} is preceded by another text, this text is repeated at 
the start of each line. Text that follows multiline {word} is not repeated 
thus you can see it only on the last line. Example: >
        S$hide#H# $description#flbeg:F# E
expands to >
        FSH First line of description
        SH second line of description
        SH last line of description E

Note you can’t have two multiline {word}s on one line.

Possible {word}s:
Word         Description ~
hide         Requires one positional parameter. $hide#{text}# is just like 
             plain {text}, except that with $hide {text} will be highlighted 
             using |hl-Ignore| highlighting group. It is useful if you want to 
             be able to properly highlight multiline {word}s.
empty        Nothing. Should be used to include empty line somewhere or force 
             generator not to throw away some line.
branch       String, branch name. Accepts one positional parameter which 
             determines whether “default” branch should be shown. Any value 
             other then "keep" will tell template engine not to show the 
             branch name in this case. Default value: "keep".
hex, user    String with value equal to the value of corresponding changeset 
             property.
rev          Like above, but also accepts additional argument which determines 
             whether revision should be shown if |aurum-repo.hasrevisions| is 
             false. Any value of this additional argument that is not equal to 
             "keep" designates that it should be ignored in this case.
             Default value: "ignore".
time         String representation of the date. Accepts one positional 
             parameter: string that will be passed to |strftime()| to format 
             the time. Default value: "%d %b %Y %H:%M".
parents, children
             List of space-separated hashes designating parents or children of 
             current changeset.
parents_, children_
             List of hashes designating parents or children of current 
             changeset, each on its own line.
tags, bookmarks
             List of tags or bookmarks separated by the first positional 
             parameter (default value: ", ").
tags_, bookmarks_
             List of tags or bookmarks, each on its own line.
summary      First line of description.
description  (multiline) Description of a changeset.
patch        (multiline) Differences introduced by processed changeset. Not 
             shown unless “patch” option was given.
stat         (multiline) Summary of changes introduced by processed changeset. 
             Not shown unless “stat” option was given.
files, changes
             (complex multiline) Files that were changed in processed 
             revision. “files” will only show modified and added files (files 
             that are present in processed changeset), “changes” will also 
             show removed files. Accepts one positional parameter: string used 
             to separate two filenames (default: ", "). Not shown unless 
             “showfiles” option was given.
renames, copies
             (complex multiline) Renames or copies in a form {src}{p1}{dest}. 
             Accepts one positional parameter: string used to separate two 
             filenames (default: " to "). Not shown unless “showrenames” or 
             “showcopies” option was given.

Note that in all styles handling of “stat” and “patch” |:AuLog| options is the 
     same: required info is added to the end of the block, “stat” goes first.

     Timezone info is never present as aurum does not use it, all dates are 
     shown using local time. I won’t fix this: Vim built-in |strftime()| 
     function does not accept timezone argument and I do not think it is worth 
     implementing in vimscript.

7. Special tabs

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.1. Record tab                                                 *aurum-record*

Record tab is used to interactively select changes that should be committed. 
|:AuRecord| command opens a new tab page and splits it into three windows: 
recorded, original and status:
  +------------------+------------------+ `
  |                  |                  | `
  |                  |                  | `
  |                  |                  | `
  |     recorded     |     original     | `
  |                  |                  | `
  |                  |                  | `
  |                  |                  | `
  +------------------+------------------+ `
  |                                     | `
  |                status               | `
  |                                     | `
  +-------------------------------------+ `
After entering record tab status window becomes focused. It contains output 
similar to the output of |:AuStatus| command, but with one additional column 
added at the beginning of the line. This column may contain one of four status 
characters:
Character  Meaning ~
    -      Changes done to this file won’t be committed (default)
    +      All changes done to this file will be committed
    *      You have made changes to this file in record tab. These changes 
           will be commited
    ^      You have made changes to this file in record tab, but then chose 
           not to commit them. They will reappear again when you use 
           |aurum-m-AuRecord_Edit| mapping
In status window there are additional mappings available (mgid=AuRecord, 
without leader by default):                             *g:frawormap_AuRecord*
                    *g:frawormap_AuRecord_Edit* *g:frawormap_AuRecord_Undo*
                    *g:frawormap_AuRecord_Redo* *g:frawormap_AuRecord_Earlier*
                    *g:frawormap_AuRecord_Later*    *aurum-m-AuRecord_Later*
                        *aurum-m-AuRecord_Redo*     *aurum-m-AuRecord_Earlier*
                        *aurum-m-AuRecord_Edit*     *aurum-m-AuRecord_Undo*
Mapping  LHS  Description ~
Edit      O   Edit file under cursor. In original window there will be changed 
              version of file (for modified files) or nothing (files with 
              other statuses when edited for the first time), in recorded 
              window there will be version of file that will be committed 
              (initially unmodified compared to version stored in repository). 
              If file is edited for the second time in recorded window there 
              will be version of file modified in record tab and in original 
              window there will be backup of the file (or version from 
              repository if file in question was removed or deleted).
Undo      u   Undo adds/removes of the file (|u|). Won’t undo changes made to 
              the file using Edit mapping unless |g:aurum_fullundo| is set.
Redo    <C-r> Like above, but redoes (|CTRL-R|).
Earlier   g-  Like above, but uses |g-|. Unlike |g-| is subject to 'timeout'.
Later     g+  Like above, but uses |g+|. Unlike |g+| is subject to 'timeout'.
Note: undoing/redoing changes using other ways is not supported unless 
      |g:aurum_fullundo| is set.

|:AuRecord| also makes some AuStatus mappings change their meaning:
Mapping                 New meaning ~
|aurum-m-AuStatus_Track|  select changes made to file(s) for committing
|aurum-m-AuStatus_Commit| close record tab and commit selected changes
|aurum-m-AuStatus_Forget| unselect changes made to file(s), don’t commit them

Note that if you close status window you will also close record tab discarding 
     all changes you have made.

|:AuRecord| defines the following mappings in recorded window 
(mgid=AuRecordLeft, default leader: "<Leader>"):    *g:frawormap_AuRecordLeft*
          *g:frawormap_AuRecordLeft_Discard* *g:frawormap_AuRecordLeft_Exit*
          *g:frawormap_AuRecordLeft_Commit*  *g:frawormap_AuRecordLeft_Remove*
          *g:frawormap_AuRecordLeft_Finish*      *aurum-m-AuRecordLeft_Finish*
              *aurum-m-AuRecordLeft_Discard*     *aurum-m-AuRecordLeft_Exit*
              *aurum-m-AuRecordLeft_Commit*      *aurum-m-AuRecordLeft_Remove*
Mapping  LHS  Description ~
Discard   x   Discard all changes made to edited file. If file is opened for 
              the second time only unsaved changes will be discarded.
Exit      X   Close record tab, discarding all changes made to all files and 
              not committing anything.
Commit    i   Commit selected changes and close record tab.
Remove    R   Like Discard, but also unselect it (makes difference if file is 
              edited for the second time).
Finish    A   Write changes and switch to status buffer.

8. Internal objects                                            *aurum-objects*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.1. Repository                                             *aurum-repository*

Repository is a dictionary containing at least the following keys:

changesets :: {hex : cs}                               *aurum-repo.changesets*
    Dictionary containing all |aurum-changeset| objects that are associated 
    with the repository. For each changeset cs is repo.changesets[cs.hex].
mutable :: a                                              *aurum-repo.mutable*
    Any mutable data needed by repository functions. This and previous keys 
    are the only ones that are not locked after repository object was created.
local :: Bool                                               *aurum-repo.local*
    1 if repository is local, 0 otherwise.
    Note that aurum is really useless for working with remote repositories.
path :: path                                                 *aurum-repo.path*
    String which was passed to |aurum-rf-repo| function.
hypsites :: [(expr, dict)]                               *aurum-repo.hypsites*
    List of pairs that determines how string returned by 
    |aurum-rf-getrepoprop| with (repo, "url") as arguments should be 
    transformed into a URL by |:AuHyperlink| command. First expression is 
    “matcher”: if it evaluates to true, then expressions from the following 
    dictionary will be used, keys are same as url types (|aurum-ho-url|). 
    Unsupported URL types should not be represented by dictionary key. 
    Additional keys “hline” and “aline” stand for URL fragments pointing to 
    the specified line (“hline” for “html”, “aline” for “annotate”) (without 
    the leading hash).
    Local variables you can use in expressions:
        Variable   Description ~
        repo       Repository object (|aurum-repository|).
        hex        Changeset hash (|aurum-cs.hex|) (url≠clone,push).
        url        URL of remote repository from local repository 
                   configuration.
        protocol, user, password, domain, port, path
                   For {protocol}://{user}:{password}@{domain}:{port}{path} 
                   each variable contains the value of {varname}. {path} must 
                   start with either forward slash or colon and contains 
                   everything after it. Each part may be omitted.
        matcher    First item in the current pair.
        dict       Second item in the current pair.
        utype      URL type.
        line       Line number (only inside “hline” and “aline” expressions).
    You should not normally use or alter this key, use |g:aurum_hypsites| if 
    you want to add support for particular remote repository.
labeltypes :: [ String ]                               *aurum-repo.labeltypes*
    List of label types supported by |aurum-rf-label|. First type will be 
    default used by |:AuName|.
requires_sort :: Bool                               *aurum-repo.requires_sort*
    Determines whether it is necessary to run sort_in_topological_order 
    function on commit lists returned by |aurum-rf-revrange| and 
    |aurum-rf-getchangesets| when it is about to be displayed in |aurum://log| 
    buffer. If it is false, then this list will only be reversed 
    (|reverse()|).
    See |aurum-rf-getchangesets| for the description of what “topological 
    order” is.
    This key is optional, default value: true.
has_octopus_merges :: Bool                     *aurum-repo.has_octopus_merges*
    Determines whether repository has merges containing more then two parents. 
    In this case slower, but more universal algorithm will be used.
    This key is optional, default value: true.
has_merges :: Bool                                     *aurum-repo.has_merges*
    Determines whether repository history can contain any merges. If false, 
    uses the fastest and the simplest graphing algorithm: “just draw a line in 
    a first column”.
    This key is optional, default value: true.
hexreg :: Regex                                            *aurum-repo.hexreg*
    Determines regular expression which must be matched by any |aurum-cs.hex| 
    value. If present, this |regex| will be used in syntax rules generated by 
    autoload/aurum/log, otherwise two syntax rules will be constructed: one 
    rule that matches exactly 12 first hexadecimal numbers (|/\x|) followed by 
    another rule than matches any positive number of hexadecimal characters 
    and conceals them (requires |+conceal| to work properly).
revreg :: Regex                                            *aurum-repo.revreg*
    Like |aurum-repo.hexreg|, but for |aurum-cs.rev|. Default is \d\+ (|\d|).
hasrevisions :: Bool                                 *aurum-repo.hasrevisions*
    Determines whether |aurum-cs.rev| contains something different from 
    abbreviated hash. If this option is false, then in log produced by 
    |aurum://log| revisions will be ignored.
    This key is optional, default value: true.
initprops :: [ propname ]                               *aurum-repo.initprops*
    Contains list of properties that are always set by |aurum-rf-getcs|.
    This key is optional, default value: ["rev", "hex", "parents", "tags", 
    "bookmarks", "branch", "time", "user", "description"]
                                                        *aurum-repo.iterfuncs*
iterfuncs :: {String : {"start": startfunc, "next": nextfunc}}
        startfunc :: repo, opts -> d
         nextfunc :: d -> cs
    Dictionary containing keys "ancestors", "revrange" and "changesets" (all 
    are optional). Each key’s value should be a reference to a function that 
    accepts |aurum-repo| dictionary and |:AuLog| options dictionary and 
    returns a dictionary containing at least the “next” key. The “next” value 
    is a function reference that has previously returned dictionary in |self| 
    variable and must return either a |aurum-changeset| or zero indicating 
    that there are no changesets left. If there is “csnum” key its value will 
    be used for progress bar to determine how many revisions should be 
    processed. Returned changeset objects must be sorted in topological order 
    like described under |aurum-rf-getchangesets|.
    Note: try to omit processsing options dictionary more then it is required 
          to do the job (see below). It will be done in any case by log 
          generator function.

    Value of "changesets" key will be used to view full repository history.
    Value of "revrange" key will be used to view history between specified 
    revisions (they will be contained in opts.revrange).
    Value of "ancestors" key will be used to view specific changesets 
    ancestors (it will be contained in opts.revision).

    This key is optional, see |aurum-new-driver|. If some of keys inside 
    iterfuncs dictionary are missing they will also be added.
functions :: {String : FRef}                            *aurum-repo.functions*
    Dictionary that contains all driver-specific functions. All functions 
    except |aurum-rf-repo|, |aurum-rf-checkdir| and |aurum-rf-checkremote| 
    accept repository object as its first argument, so it is not mentioned in 
    function descriptions. Here is the list:
  getcs :: hex -> cs                                          *aurum-rf-getcs*
    Returns |aurum-changeset| object which has given hash. See also 
    |aurum-cs.hex|.
  getwork :: () -> cs                                       *aurum-rf-getwork*
    Get changeset object for the working directory revision.
  getnthparent :: hex, n[, [ file ]] -> cs             *aurum-rf-getnthparent*
    Get nth generation grand-parent of given revision. Use negative n to get 
    nth generation child instead. With n equal to zero it must work like 
    |aurum-rf-getcs|(hex).
                                                    *aurum-rf-getnthchangerev*
  getnthchangerev :: hex, n, [ file ] -> (cs, [ file ])
    Like above, but with two differences:
    1. Only changesets containing changes to files listed in the fourth 
       argument are taken into account.
    2. Returns a pair of |aurum-changeset| object and a list of files. In case 
       there were no renames returned list is equal to the list given in 
       arguments, otherwise it returns list with new filenames.
       Note: copies are ignored.
  getchangesets :: () -> [ cs ]                       *aurum-rf-getchangesets*
    Pull all changesets contained in repository into |aurum-repo.changesets| 
    dictionary. If this function is not called, then |aurum-repo.changesets| 
    dictionary contains only changesets that were used at least ones. Returns 
    list of pulled changesets. This list should be sorted in topological order 
    (thus meaning that every changeset appears before every its parent) or 
    |aurum-repo.requires_sort| should be set to true.
  revrange :: hex, hex -> [ cs ]                           *aurum-rf-revrange*
    Get revision range (inclusive).
  updatechangesets :: () -> _                      *aurum-rf-updatechangesets*
    Updates data stored in repository. Is called each time when you get the 
    repository object unless this object is obtained from cash used by 
    |aurum#repository()|.
  getrevhex :: csdescr -> hex                             *aurum-rf-getrevhex*
    Given some changeset description (it may be tag, bookmark, branch name, 
    revision number, ... - whatever VCS supports) get changeset hash.
    Note that functions mentioned above may support not only revision hashes 
         in place of {hex} arguments, but also whatever “getrevhex” supports, 
         but this is not guaranteed. For example, status() accepts revision 
         number in both mercurial drivers, but though zero is a valid 
         revision, it is used to indicate absence of an argument and thus you 
         have to write "0" (String) where you want to write just 0 (Number).
  gettiphex :: () -> hex                                  *aurum-rf-gettiphex*
    Get changeset hash of the last revision in a repository.
  getworkhex :: () -> hex                                *aurum-rf-getworkhex*
    Get changeset hash of the working directory revision.
  setcsprop :: cs, propname -> _                          *aurum-rf-setcsprop*
    Function that adds requested property to given changeset. Is used by 
    default |aurum-rf-getcsprop| if changeset dictionary does not contain 
    property with given name.
  getcsprop :: cs | hex, propname -> propvalue            *aurum-rf-getcsprop*
    Returns requested changeset property. Can accept either |aurum-changeset| 
    object or changeset hash. “propname” can be a name of any property 
    described in |aurum-changeset| section, but it should be normally used for 
    pulling properties that are not obtained by |aurum-rf-getcs| by default: 
    “files”, “changes”, “renames”, “copies”, “allfiles”, “chidlren”.
                                                             *aurum-rf-status*
  status :: [hex[, hex[, [ file ][, clean[, ign]]]]] -> {status : [ file ]}
    Returns dictionary where values are lists of files and keys are 
    "modified", "added" (new tracked files), "removed" (made untracked, not 
    necessary deleted from filesystem), "deleted" (just deleted from 
    filesystem without making files untracked), "unknown" (new untracked 
    files), "ignored" and "clean" (unmodified).
    Specifying 0 instead of any optional argument acts like not specifying 
    this argument.
    Note: “clean” may be empty unless {clean} argument is present and true. 
          Same for “ignored” and {ign}. {ign} argument is likely to be ignored 
          itself unless two first optional arguments are absent or zero.
  dirty :: file -> Bool                                       *aurum-rf-dirty*
    Check whether file is “dirty” (meaning that it has changes that can be 
    committed).
                                                             *aurum-rf-commit*
  commit :: message[, [ file ][, user[, date[, closebranch]]]] -> _
    Commit changes made to specified files (default depends on VCS, normally 
    it is “commit changes made to all tracked files (including additions and 
    removes))”. “closebranch” and “force” arguments have Bool type, “user” and 
    “date” are strings. Neither “user” nor “date” argument should have any 
    normalized form, they just should be accepted by VCS.
  strip :: [hex[, force]] -> _                                *aurum-rf-strip*
    Delete a changeset and its descendants. Default changeset is a working 
    directory one.
  branch :: branch, force -> _                               *aurum-rf-branch*
    Create new branch.
  label :: type, label, hex, force, local -> _                *aurum-rf-label*
    Label specific revision (if rev is 0 then remove label).
    Note: if this function accepts label with type {type}, 
          |aurum-rf-getrepoprop| must be able to list labels of this type in 
          property "{type}slist".
  update :: hex, force                                       *aurum-rf-update*
    Update working directory to changeset {hex}.
  move :: force, fdir, file -> _                               *aurum-rf-move*
  copy :: force, fdir, file -> _                               *aurum-rf-copy*
    Move or copy given file or directory (second argument) to given 
    destination (third argument).
    Note: directories are always passed with trailing forward slash.
  add    :: fdir -> _                                        *aurum-rf-add*
  forget :: fdir -> _                                        *aurum-rf-forget*
  remove :: fdir -> _                                        *aurum-rf-remove*
  ignore :: fdir -> _                                        *aurum-rf-ignore*
    Forget, remove, add (make tracked) or ignore (add to .hgignore or 
    something similar) given file or directory. “ignore” function properly 
    escapes file if it happen to contain any wildcards.
    Note: directories are always passed with trailing forward slash.
  ignoreglob :: glob -> _                                *aurum-rf-ignoreglob*
    Add given glob to .hgignore or similar.
                                                               *aurum-rf-grep*
  grep :: pattern, [ file ], [ Either hex (hex, hex) ], ic, wdf -> qflist
    Search repository for given pattern and return results in a list that can 
    be passed to |setqflist()| function with small modifications (see below). 
    Second argument here controls what files should be searched for. Third 
    controls revisions that are to be searched (tuple variant: range of 
    revisions). {ic} determines whether case should be ignored and {wdf} 
    determines whether grep should output files in working directory if they 
    have not changed since found revision.
    Note: If you want to use grep() directly, you should remember that 
          “filename” key may contain either an absolute filename or pair 
          (revision, filename (relative to repository root)). Second is to be 
          transformed into |aurum://file| path.
  readfile :: repo, hex, file -> [ String ]                *aurum-rf-readfile*
    Returns a list of strings (similar to |readfile()| output with "b" flag 
    set) that contains file contents as it was at given revision.
  annotate :: repo, hex, file -> [ rev ]                   *aurum-rf-annotate*
    Returns a list of 3-tuples: ({hex}, {file}, {line-number}), one 3-tuple 
    for each line of the file as it was at given changeset. {hex} must be 
    anything supported by |aurum-rf-getcs|, {file} is a filename (in case this 
    function is able to track copies or renames) and {line-number} is number 
    of the corresponding line in that file as it was at that revision.
    If {line-number} is 0, then |aurum://annotate| mappings will use line 
    contents to search for the same line in another revision.
  diff :: hex, hex, [ file ], diffopts -> [ String ]           *aurum-rf-diff*
    Returns list of strings (similar to |readfile()| output with "b" flag set) 
    that contains changes made to given files between given revisions. If list 
    of files is empty, then changes made to all files will be returned. See 
    |aurum-diffopts| for description of {diffopts} argument.
                                                       *aurum-rf-difftobuffer*
  difftobuffer :: bufnr, hex, hex, [ file ], diffopts -> + buffer
    Like writing output of |aurum-rf-diff| to specified buffer.
  diffre :: diffopts -> regex                                *aurum-rf-diffre*
    Returns a regular expression that will be used for searching diff section 
    headers (normally lines starting with ^diff) and obtaining file names from 
    them. Is used by a number of command for obtaining current file name while 
    in diff buffer and also by |aurum-rf-getstats| function.
  diffname :: line, regex, diffopts -> fname               *aurum-rf-diffname*
    Given {line} that matches {regex} returned by |aurum-rf-diffre|, return 
    a filename.
  getstats :: diff, diffopts -> stats                      *aurum-rf-getstats*
    Returns a dictionary describing summary of changes described in {diff} (it 
    is what |aurum-rf-diff| returns). Dictionary will contain the following 
    keys:
    Key         Description ~
    insertions  Number of lines inserted.
    deletions   Number of lines deleted.
    files       Dictionary where keys are file names and values are 
                dictionaries with two keys: “insertions” and “deletions”. They 
                contain same information as above stats keys, but these 
                statistics refers to one file only.
  getrepoprop :: propname -> propvalue                  *aurum-rf-getrepoprop*
    Get some repository property. Supported {propname}s:
    Property name  Description ~
    tagslist, brancheslist, bookmarkslist
                   List of strings containing tags, branches and bookmarks 
                   present in current repo respectively. Is used for 
                   completion in commands that accept {rev} argument and by 
                   |:AuBranch| and |:AuName| in order to check whether branch 
                   can be created/revision can be named.
    url            Remote repository URL. For mercurial it is either 
                   paths.default-push or paths.default whichever is defined.
    branch         Current branch, likely an equivalent for getting value of 
                   “branch” key from changeset object returned by 
                   |aurum-rf-getwork|. Used for |aurum#branch()|.
  reltorepo :: path -> path                               *aurum-rf-reltorepo*
    Turn absolute or relative to current directory path into relative to 
    repository root one.
  push :: dryrun, force[, url[, rev]] -> _                     *aurum-rf-push*
  pull :: dryrun, force[, url[, rev]] -> _                     *aurum-rf-pull*
    Push or pull to given or default URL. If {rev} argument is present, then 
    push/pull only this revision. {dryrun} designates that nothing should be 
    actually done, only what will be done should be shown. When pulling it 
    also updates working directory (for consistency: only mercurial supports 
    convenient pulls without updates).
    Note: unlike other functions, this should expect any possible revision 
          specification.
    Note 2: if URL is a directory, it is supposed to be related to repository 
            root, not to current working directory.
The following functions do not accept repo argument:
  repo :: path -> repo                                         *aurum-rf-repo*
    Creates new repository object using repository located at given path.
    Note you must not ever use this directly, this is to be called by repo.get 
         function from autoload/aurum/repo. If you use it directly, you will 
         be missing some setup that will render newly created object useless.
  checkdir    :: path -> Bool                           *aurum-rf-checkdir*
  checkremote :: path -> Bool                           *aurum-rf-checkremote*
    These two functions check whether given path contains repository supported 
    by specific driver. First is called once for each directory in path, 
    ending with root (drive name like “C:” in windows, “/” in POSIX OS’es) and 
    is likely to contain something as simple as >
        function s:driver.checkdir(path)
            return isdirectory(a:path."/.hg")
        endfunction
<   . Second is called once on paths that contain “://” in their string (it is 
    likely to return just 0 because normal work with remote repositories is 
    impossible in most VCS’es).
  getroot :: path -> path|0                                 *aurum-rf-getroot*
    Being given a path for which |aurum-rf-checkdir| returns true should 
    return a repository root.
    If absent acts like the below function, thus considering any directory for 
    which |aurum-rf-checkdir| returns true being a repository root >
        function s:driver.getroot(path)
            return a:path
        endfunction
<                                                          *aurum-repeatedcmd*
The following functions accept repo argument, but may be absent (dummy ones 
throwing nimp exception are not created):
                                                            *aurum-rf-astatus*
  astatus :: interval, [hex[, hex[, [ file ][, clean[, ign]]]]] -> rcid
  agetcs :: interval, rev -> rcid                            *aurum-rf-agetcs*
  agetrepoprop :: interval, propname -> rcid           *aurum-rf-agetrepoprop*
    Register asyncronous repeated every {interval} seconds |aurum-rf-status|, 
    |aurum-rf-getcs| or |aurum-rf-getrepoprop| calls (really their pure python 
    replacements). Return an ID. Use |aurum-rf-aget| to get actual aurum-rf-* 
    output. All currently existing implementations require python-2* with 
    working threading module.
  aget :: rcid[, now] -> ?                                     *aurum-rf-aget*
    Output current value of repeatedly run function. With {now} set to true it 
    is not using cache.
  aremove :: rcid                                           *aurum-rf-aremove*
    Stop repeating functions.
  apause :: rcid                                             *aurum-rf-apause*
  aresume :: rcid                                           *aurum-rf-aresume*
    Pause and resume execution (i.e. process is not deleted like with aremove, 
    but it only sleeps in paused state).

9. Creating your own driver                                 *aurum-new-driver*
                                                           *aurum-f-regdriver*
In order to create driver you must use “regdriver” feature defined in 
autoload/aurum/repo (you must specify it in dependencies and then you will get 
|s:_f|.regdriver() function). This feature accepts two arguments: name of the 
driver (only latin letters, digits and underscores are allowed, see |/\w|) and 
dictionary with repository functions (only function references are allowed):
Required functions: |aurum-rf-repo|, |aurum-rf-getcs|, |aurum-rf-checkdir|.
Optional functions:
  Function               Default behavior ~
  |aurum-rf-getnthparent|  Use |aurum-rf-getcs| and |aurum-rf-getcsprop| 
                         (properties "parents" or "children")
  |aurum-rf-getcsprop|     Checks whether requested key is present in the 
                         changeset object. If yes returns its value, otherwise 
                         calls |aurum-rf-setcsprop|.
  |aurum-rf-dirty|         Use |aurum-rf-status| and check whether file has 
                         status different from “ignored” or “clean”
  |aurum-rf-move|          Uses |aurum-rf-copy| and |aurum-rf-remove| to 
                         emulate renaming command.
  |aurum-rf-copy|          Copies file to destination (using command-line “cp” 
                         (cp -- source target), “copy” (copy source target) or 
                         |readfile()| + |writefile()| (in last case 
                         permissions are not copied)), then uses 
                         |aurum-rf-add| to make destination tracked.
  |aurum-rf-remove|        Uses |aurum-rf-forget| to untrack file and then 
                         |delete()|s it.
  |aurum-rf-grep|          Does just the same what git grep does: iterates 
                         over given revisions and searches for given regular 
                         expression (in this case: vim |regexp|) in each file. 
                         If third argument is empty, then searches working 
                         directory versions of files present in current 
                         changeset. Uses |aurum-rf-getcsprop| (with “allfiles” 
                         argument), |aurum-rf-revrange|, |aurum-rf-getcs| and 
                         |aurum-rf-readfile|.
                         Slow!
  |aurum-rf-difftobuffer|  Wrapper around |aurum-rf-diff|.
  |aurum-rf-diffname|      Uses value of first capturing group of given 
                         regular expression.
  |aurum-rf-getstats|      Parses git-like unified diff, depends on 
                         |aurum-rf-diffre| and |aurum-rf-diffname|.
  |aurum-rf-reltorepo|     Uses |aurum-repo.path| to get requested path.
  |aurum-rf-checkremote|   Returns 0.
  |aurum-repo.iterfuncs|   "changeset": Uses |aurum-rf-getchangesets|
                         "revrange": Uses |aurum-rf-revrange|
                         "ancestors": Iterates recursively over 
                                      |aurum-cs.parents|, parents of the 
                                      parents and so on.
  |aurum-rf-aget|          Uses aurum.repeatedcmd.get.
  |aurum-rf-aremove|       Uses aurum.repeatedcmd.remove.
  |aurum-rf-apause|        Uses aurum.repeatedcmd.pause.
  |aurum-rf-aresume|       Uses aurum.repeatedcmd.resume.
Other functions, mentioned in |aurum-repo.functions|, but not mentioned here, 
throw an "nimp" exception (except for |aurum-repeatedcmd| functions, they may 
be absent, but they never throw "nimp").

10. Notes about various driver implementations            *aurum-driver-notes*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.1. Mercurial                                       *aurum-driver-Mercurial*

|aurum-rf-label|:
    Supported labels: tag (non-local/local), bookmark (non-local).

|aurum-repo.hypsites|:
    1. When processing various git repositories checked out using hg-git 
       (http://hg-git.github.com/) it is assumed that |aurum-cs.hex| can be 
       replaced with first bookmark or first tag that starts with "default/" 
       with "default/" part removed.
    2. Svn revisions are not supported at all, |aurum-cs.hex| in driver is 
       replaced with static string "HEAD".
|aurum-rf-status|: For non-python driver this function does not support names 
    containing newlines.
|aurum-rf-diff| requires at least mercurial-1.4 to support reverse diff 
    option.
|aurum-rf-getcsprop|(…, "children") requires at least mercurial-1.7 or manual 
    preceding |aurum-rf-getchangesets| call. Thus many Next mappings do not 
    work.
|aurum-rf-strip| without arguments uses “hg rollback”, with: “hg strip”. It is 
    not guaranteed that using “hg rollback” to strip changesets will.
|aurum-rf-astatus| in “non-python” version supports only 
    status(repo,0,0,[file],1,1) calls.
|aurum-rf-agetcs| is absent in non-python version of driver.
|aurum-rf-agetrepoprop| in “non-python” version supports only “branch” 
    property.
*aurum-rf-svnrev* exists and produces svn revision number out of repository 
    object and mercurial revision specification.
*aurum-rf-githex* exists and produces git sha1 out of repository object and 
    mercurial revision specification. This function is present only when using 
    python version of driver.
*aurum-rf-phase* exists and changes phase of the given changeset when called 
    with repository, mercurial revision specification and one of phase names 
    (public, draft, secret). Optionally accepts boolean as the fourth argument 
    (equivalent to “hg phase --force”).
Python driver was not tested under windows (wine) at all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.2. Git                                                   *aurum-driver-Git*

|aurum-rf-label|: Supported labels: tag, branch (both non-local).

|aurum-cs.branch| always contains string "default".
|aurum-cs.tags| contains list of all references pointing to given commit, not 
    just tags.
|aurum-cs.rev| contains truncated hash (for use in |aurum://annotate|).
|aurum-cs.phase| is always “unknown”.
|aurum-rf-status|: if at least one of first two optional arguments is 
    non-zero, then then unknown and deleted files won’t be shown (if any). 
    Ignored files are shown only when the first two optional arguments are 
    absent or equal to null.
|aurum-rf-gettiphex|: Same as |aurum-rf-getworkhex|.
|aurum-rf-diff|: Options "git", "iblanks", "showfunc", "dates" are not 
    supported.
|aurum-rf-checkdir| does not support bare repositories.
|aurum-rf-setcsprop|: is not able to get real renames, copies, changes, files 
    and removes for merge changesets (“real” here means “generated by merge 
    conflicts”: if file A was modified in both parents, then it is to be 
    listed in merge_cs.changes only if git was unable to merge changes and had 
    to ask user to do this).
|aurum-rf-grep| will either search working directory (if no revisions were 
    given) or given revisions (mercurial driver is searching all revisions if 
    no revisions are given). Unlike mercurial where matching line will be 
    shown only if they were found in first revision in range or in line that 
    was added/modified in given revision, with this function you will see all 
    matches in all revisions.
    Note: This function always uses extended regular expressions.
|aurum-rf-annotate| won’t output annotation of file in working directory, it 
    is always returning annotation of file at given revision.
|aurum-rf-update| will avoid “detached HEAD” state whenever possible. In order 
    to make this behavior sensible it has a hack for |:AuUpdate| with branch 
    name as an argument, but it may also search .git/refs/heads for {hex} 
    argument and use first found file with contents equal to {hex} as a branch 
    name.
|aurum-rf-astatus| supports only status(repo,0,0,[file],1,1) calls.
|aurum-rf-agetcs| is absent.
|aurum-rf-agetrepoprop| supports only “branch” property.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.3. Subversion                                     *aurum-driver-Subversion*

|aurum-rf-label|, |aurum-rf-branch| are not supported.

|aurum-cs.branch| always contains string "default".
|aurum-cs.rev| and |aurum-cs.hex| have the same value, though second one is 
    a string.
|aurum-cs.time| is always 0 if “date” programm from coreutils is missing.
|aurum-cs.hex| contains the stringified value of |aurum-cs.rev| and thus is 
    not fixed-length.
|aurum-cs.phase| is always “public”.
|aurum-rf-diff|: Options "git", "iblanks", "dates", "alltext" are not 
    supported, option "reverse" is supported only if two revisions are given.
|aurum-rf-status|: if at least one of first two optional arguments is 
    non-zero, then then unknown and deleted files won’t be shown (if any). 
    Ignored files are not shown in any case.
    Note: this function may output directories in a list.
|aurum-rf-annotate| neither tracks renames/copies nor is able to output line 
    numbers.
|aurum-rf-grep| uses internal grep implementation based on 
    |aurum-rf-readfile|. Thus it is slow, but supports vim |regexp|.
    See more in |aurum-f-regdriver|.
|aurum-rf-ignoreglob| uses “svn propset svn:ignore” and thus is limited to 
    non-recursive globs applying to exactly one directory: ignoring 
    “subdir*/ignored*” will ignore all files with names starting with 
    “ignored” in a directory “subdir*”, which is probably not what you 
    initially wanted.
|aurum-rf-pull| uses “svn update” to pull and “svn log” for incoming.
|aurum-rf-push| is not defined.
|aurum-rf-astatus| supports only status(repo,0,0,[file],1,1) calls.
|aurum-rf-agetcs| is absent.
|aurum-rf-agetrepoprop| is absent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.4. Bazaar                                             *aurum-driver-Bazaar*

|aurum-rf-label|: Supported labels: tag (non-local).

|aurum-cs.time| is always 0 if “date” programm from coreutils is missing.
|aurum-cs.children| is always empty.
|aurum-cs.phase| is always “unknown”.
|aurum-rf-getchangesets|, |aurum-rf-getcs| are unable to work with commits 
    where description contains line with two spaces followed by 60 dashes.
|aurum-rf-updatechangesets| is doing nothing.
|aurum-rf-getrevhex| calls |aurum-rf-getcs| thus it may be slow.
|aurum-rf-getcsprop| does not support “copies” property (because copies, 
    unlike renames, are not supported by bazaar itself).
|aurum-rf-status| assumes that when renaming old file name does not contain 
    string “ => ” and all file names do not contain "\n  " or "\nsmth:".
    Ignored files are shown only when the first two optional arguments are 
    absent or equal to null.
|aurum-rf-branch| renames branch instead of creating a new one.
|aurum-rf-update| uses revert+update for forced update.
|aurum-rf-grep| uses internal grep implementation based on 
    |aurum-rf-readfile|. Thus it is slow, but supports vim |regexp|.
    See more in |aurum-f-regdriver|.
|aurum-rf-annotate| is not able to output line numbers.
|aurum-rf-diff| requires “diff” programm from diffutils to be installed in 
    order to pass any of diffoptions. Support for the reverse diff option is 
    limited to the case when both revisions are specified.
|aurum-rf-diffname| will work incorrectly if filenames containing “' => '” 
    were renamed.
|aurum-repo.iterfuncs| is missing (yet).
|aurum-rf-astatus| in “non-python” version supports only 
    status(repo,0,0,[file],1,1) calls.
|aurum-rf-agetcs| is absent.
|aurum-rf-agetrepoprop| in “non-python” version supports only “branch” 
    property.
